# Personal Website Exemplar Project

In this lab, you'll create a personal website for a peer using HTML and CSS. A personal website is a great way for someone to showcase their work and introduce themselves to future employers. You'll start by interviewing your partner and creating a wireframe to plan the vision for the website. You'll use HTML to build the website sections and content and CSS to add visual appeal and responsiveness.

When you've finished, you'll share the website you developed with your partner, and your partner will share your website with you. We encourage you to update your website with any new projects you create as you continue to build on your full-stack web development knowledge throughout this course and beyond!
